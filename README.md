# Selenium Automation Project

Welcome to the Selenium Automation Demo Project! This project serves as hands-on demonstration of Selenium, an open-source automation testing framework widely used for web applications. Whether you're a beginner looking to explore the basics or an experienced tester aiming to enhance your Selenium skills, this project provides a practical guide to automation testing.
For demo, I am using https://www.saucedemo.com/ website.

- Maven project
- Sington design pattern implementation
- Reading data in multiple ways
    - via .properties file
    - from @DataProvider method
    - from <parameter> added in testng.xml
- Running test cases 
    - single test class
    - multiple test classes by added under testng.xml
    - using maven surefire plugin
- Integration of Listerners provided by testng
- Integration of Logger
- Execution report using Extent Report

## Project Folder Structure
 It has 3 source folders

    1. src/main/java - contains all code except test cases
    2. src/test/java - contains test case classes
    3. src/test/resource - contails configurations, test data related files

Here is a screenshot:

## Framework

Used testNg and POM results in hybrid Framework
It has following components:

    1. Test Base
    2. Page Object Repository
    3. Test Cases
    4. Test Data
    5. Configurations
    6. Utilities
    7. Report

Here is a framework flow diagram

## Execution Report
- Once the Execution is done, the report is available under Reports folder
- If any test case fails, it will take the screen shot and attach it to the execution report.
